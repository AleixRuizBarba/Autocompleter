# Autocompleter
A simple autocompleter program created for the Epitech "Open Job Day".

## Compilation instructions
To compile the program, you should have **.NET 7.0 Runtime** installed. In case you don't, you can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/es-es/download).

You can check if you installed it correctly or you already had it running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
dotnet --version

Once you have everything set up, you can compile the program running the following command in the terminal:
dotnet publish -c Release

IMPORTANT: You should always run this command in the folder you have the repository installed.

# Run instructions
To run the compiled program, you have to find the path to it. Normally, it will be in bin/Release/net7.0/, named Autocompleter. Once you know the path to the program, you should run the following command in the terminal:
./bin/Release/net7.0/Autocompleter

IMPORTANT: You should always give it an argument, if not, it will throw an error. Example: ./bin/Release/net7.0/Autocompleter p (In this case, p is the argument).
